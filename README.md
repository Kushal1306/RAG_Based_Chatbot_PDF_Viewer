# RAG_Based_Chatbot_PDF_Viewer
RAG Based Chatbot which answers users query Based on knowledge Base provided.

Front End:

Tools used:

i) HTML: HTML was used to create forms to enter the query and accept the pdf file, buttons, and other elements.

ii) CSS: It was used to style the frontend part.

iii) Javascript: It was used to make communications with the backend so that it interacts with the backend server. Like sending requests and getting responses from the server.

We embedded the annotated pdf file sent by the server in HTML documents.

Back End:

The backend accepts the query and pdf files, generates responses, and sends responses and an annotated pdf file with highlighted answers.

Tools used:Â 

Flask was used to handle the HTTP requests and send back the responses to the client.

RAG MODEL:

We used Langchain, Faiss Vector Store, and OpenAI Embeddings' gpt 3.5 LLM to retrieve the response to the query asked by the user.

RAG stands for retrieval-augmented generation. We retrieve the relevant information based on the context provided.

We use the PyPDF library extensively for handling PDF files.

We convert the text of the pdf to vector embeddings with the help of OPENAI embeddings, and then we do similarity searches with the help of FAISS, append those top k similar texts to the existing query, and then feed that modified query to the Large Language Model, and the LLM generates the response.

Coming to the point, how do we highlight or annotate the answer in the pdf?


We use sentence transformers (semantics searchers) to find the common text between the response generated by LLM and the whole PDF text. After finding the common text, we highlight that text in the pdf with the help of the Fitz (MuPDF) library, which allows us to highlight the text in the pdf.

After highlighting the relevant text in the PDF, we render the highlighted PDF as an HTML document.

Simultaneously, we also update the answer (the response generated by LLM) as it is forwarded to the HTML document as a response.
